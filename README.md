## Recipe Recommendation System

Explore this Prolog-based recipe recommendation system, designed to help you find recipes based on available ingredients. This system is built using SWI-Prolog and offers a dynamic way to suggest recipes that can be made with the ingredients you have.

### **Features:**

- **Ingredient Input**: Enter the ingredients you have, and the system will suggest recipes you can make.
- **Recipe Database**: Contains a variety of recipes with detailed ingredient requirements.
- **Instructions**: Provides step-by-step instructions for each recipe.

### **Technologies Used:**

- **SWI-Prolog**: For implementing the logic and handling the recipe recommendations.

### **How to Use:**

1. **Start the Program**: Run the Prolog script in SWI-Prolog.
2. **Enter Ingredients**: Input your available ingredients one by one, and type `done` when finished.
3. **Get Recipe Suggestions**: The system will display recipes you can make along with detailed cooking instructions.

This project showcases the application of Prolog in a practical scenario, combining rule-based logic with real-world culinary needs.
